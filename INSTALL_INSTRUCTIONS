In order to install and run our program, both python3 and D need to be installed on the computer. Python3 should already be installed on the cmput274 vm. The D compiler is not however.

To install the D compiler, run the following commands in bash.

sudo wget http://master.dl.sourceforge.net/project/d-apt/files/d-apt.list -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/d-apt.list
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y --allow-unauthenticated install --reinstall d-apt-keyring
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install dmd-compiler dub


For a cleaner install, consider using snaps, which are built into ubuntu, note, this might take longer if snap hasn't been run in a while

sudo snap install --classic dmd && sudo snap install --classic dub

Then you can assemble coldfire assembly code by navigating to the projects root directory and calling the python module as follows

python3 assembler <filename>

for example
python3 assembler fib.s

Then, to run the assembled machine code, you must run the executable file calledcoldfire-emulator found in the emulator folder. To compile and run the code all at once, you can run

dub run

With dub, to pass the command line arguments to the executable file, you need to seperate arguments with --, so for example, if you wanted to run the fib.s19 that you just generated, you would type

dub run -- ../fib.s19

if you just wish to run an already compiled version of the emulator, from the root directory you can run 

./emulator/coldfire-emulator fib.s19
